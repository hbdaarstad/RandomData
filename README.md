A collection of data sets for POL 051: The Scientific Study of Politics at UC Davis. In this data package I have added curated datasets for my students to show them examples of code. The goal of the data package is to include various data sets to help students grasp the basics of R and concepts around analyzing and visualizing data.

Included in the data package is:

-   F1 Race Statistics
-   F1 Driver Statistics
-   F1 Constructor Statistics
-   ANES 2008 Time Series Data
-   ACLED Conflict Data from Mexico and Colombia

To install the package in R:

```{r}
 install.packages("remotes")
 remotes::install_github("hbdaarstad/RandomData")
```
